7;-Alexander;-Also often referred to as a “Brandy Alexander”, which suggest you could use other spirits in place of brandy. When faced with the constant request for a “Chocolate Martini” it can usually work to serve this and let folks know it was perhaps the “original”.;-Garnish: Sprinkle of nutmeg;-Shake with ice.

8;-Algonquin;-This cocktail was named after the Algonquin Hotel, which opened its doors in 1902 in one of New York’s most fashionable neighborhoods. The hotel gained its greatest fame a few years later as the home of the Algonquin Round Table, the ongoing literary lunch started by Murdock Pemberton and Alexander Woollcott in which Harpo Marx, Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman and their compatriots held sway on New York’s cultural scene. There were in fact several drinks named after this historic venue, but this recipe is the one currently served by the hotel’s bartenders.;-Garnish: Cherry;-Stir with ice (to prevent the pineapple juice from foaming). Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
9;-Americano;-The recipe for the Americano originated in 1861 at Gaspare Campari’s bar in Turin, Italy. But it wasn’t until Prohibition was enacted in the United States (1919-1933), that the drink was dubbed the Americano by Italians, who noticed American visitors favoring this classic aperitif. Ironically, Americans could legally sip Campari cocktails at home during Prohibition. Campari was classified by the government as a medicinal product, not an alcoholic beverage.;-Garnish: Orange wedge or twist of lemon.;-Pour Campari and sweet vermouth into highball glass filled with ice and stir. Top with soda water.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=203&width=160
10;-Aviation;-This cult favorite first appeared in 1916, in "Recipes for Mixed Drinks", by Hugo Ensslin, head bartender at Times Square’s Hotel Wallick. Ensslin’s original formula called for the drink to also include crème de violette, which tints the drink a light sky blue. It is Harry Craddock's "Savoy Cocktail Book" from 1930 in which we find the version of the Aviation without the crème de violette, but otherwise it is the exact same recipe as Mr. Ensslins.The original 1916 recipe called for 2 parts gin, 1 part lemon juice, 2 dashes of Maraschino liqueur, and 2 dashes of crème de violette.To approximate Ensslin’s original formula, mix 2 oz (60 ml) gin, 0.5 oz (15 ml) lemon juice, 2 tsp maraschino liqueur and 1 tsp crème de violette.;-Garnish: Cherry;-Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=213&width=160
11;-Bacardi Cocktail;-This drink became quite popular after Prohibition (but existed beforehand), many establishments would use whatever rum they happened to have on hand. Bacardi decided enough was enough and took the matter to court in 1936, and New York State sided with Bacardi and ruled that this drink must always be made with Bacardi rum. ;-;-Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
12;-Bellini;-To be authentic, the peach puree should be made from fresh white peaches which have been peeled and then squeezed to release their juices. Or you can use a commercial white peach puree such as from “Perfect Puree of Napa Valley”.;-;-Pour peach puree into a champagne flute, then add champagne.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
13;-Bermuda Rum Swizzle;-This is a popular drink in a variety of bars and restaurant in Bermuda. Many travelers coming back from there will ask me for the recipe, only to discover that falernum is rather hard to find up here. Fortunately that is beginning to change, and a few different brands are now available.To make this as a “true” swizzle, you would use a traditional swizzle stick to mix and froth the drink up. ;-Garnish: Slice of orange and a cherry.;-Shake with ice. Strain into an ice filled highball glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
14;-Between The Sheets;-Not many (proper) cocktails contain more than one base spirit. Since Cointreau is a full-proof product, it can almost be considered a third base spirit in this one!;-Garnish: Lemon twist.;-Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=191&width=160
15;-Bijou;-The Bijou (meaning jewel in French) cocktail was reportedly invented by Harry Johnson in the 1890's. The oldest recipe I have comes from his 1900 "New And Improved Bartenders Manual". Some think this drink should be served as a "layered" cocktail, but this is clearly not the case since Harry Johnson clearly lists the instructions as "mix well with a spoon and serve." I can understand why somebody might think the layered presentation would be more appropriate because of its name, but it was not the way this drink was originally intended to be served.;-Garnish: Cherry and a lemon twist.;-Stir with ice.

17;-Black Feather;-I specifically created this drink to be the "house cocktail" for my home bar, which I’ve nicknamed the "Black Feather". In my original recipe I used my own home-made bitters, but lacking that Angostura, or Fee's Old Fashioned Bitters will work just fine.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.

19;-Blood And Sand;-In 1922 Rudolph Valentino starred in the movie “Blood and Sand”, a movie that shortly before his death in 1926 he declared as the part he liked the best. He had just undergone a touchy surgery for appendicitis and gastric ulcers and told the gathering press “The part I like best was my role in ‘Blood and Sand’. If I had died, I would have liked to be remembered as an actor by that role – I think it my greatest.” He died a few days later from peritonitis. It is unknown who actually created the recipe for Blood and Sand, but its first appearance seems to be in “The Savoy Cocktail Book” by Harry Cradock in 1930. There it lists the recipe as equal parts of all three ingredients, but I feel that the recipe works better by boosting the scotch.;-;-Shake with ice.

25;-Bourbon Crusta;-The "Crusta" is a style of drink which harkens from the early 1800's.

31;-Caesar;-Apparently invented in 1969 by Walter Chell, the restaurant manager of the Calgary Inn in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. This drink is essentially a Bloody Mary that uses Clamato juice instead of Tomato juice. He spent three months perfecting the drink, ending up with a simple 1-2-3-4 recipe; 1 shot vodka, 2 dashes hot sauce, three dashes of salt and pepper, and four dashes of Worcestershire sauce, topped off with 4 to 6 ounces of Clamato juice, and served with ice in a glass rimmed with celery salt.The Caesar is very popular across Canada, once it was even attempted to make it the nations official drink.;-Garnish: Celery stalk and a lime wedge.;-Shake with ice. Strain into an ice filled glass, rimmed with celery salt.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
32;-Cafe Diable;-;-;-Carefully peel orange such that the peel comes off in one long spiral and set aside. Put the brandy, cloves and sugar into a chaffing dish and heat slowly. Grasp the orange peel by one end (in your left hand if you are right handed), and hold it above the chaffing dish such that the other end just touches the brandy. Using a ladle (with the other hand), scoop up some brandy, and light it from the flame below the chaffing dish. Pour the now flaming brandy gently down the orange peel as close to the top as possible. Be careful not to let any of the flaming brandy splash about. Repeat this process several times. Carefully set the orange peel aside onto a non-flammable surface. Slowly pour the coffee into the chaffing dish to extinguish the flames. Serve to guests in elegant coffee mugs.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

34;-Calvados Cocktail;-Calvados is an apple brandy famously made in the Normandy region of France. It's American counterpart is called Applejack, which in a pinch I suppose you could substitute, but only in a pinch. The Calvados Cocktail first appears in "The Savoy Cocktail Book", published in 1930 by Harry Craddock, the bartender at London's famous Savoy hotel. That recipe called for a lot more orange bitters, using essentially as much of that as there is Cointreau. I felt that was just a tad overbearing, so I've pulled it back to the more modest amount you see here. But feel free to kick it up a notch if you want!;-;-Shake with ice.

41;-Champs Elysées;-The earliest reference to the Champs Elysees that I have found, is from the 1930 edition of the Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock. In this recipe (presented in a proportion to serve 6 people) he simply listed "Chartreuse" as an ingredient, while elsewhere in the book he specifically lists recipes as using either the common green, or slightly less common yellow versions of Chartreuse, so I suppose that means you can use whichever you prefer in this drink.Lately, this drink has been showing up more frequently in many of the craft bars across the country. Where once drinks like the Aviation, and then the Last Word, were seen as drinks that proved your interest in classically crafted drinks, the Champs Elysees is the new favorite.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=222&width=160
42;-Chaplin;-I am always on the lookout for cocktails which use slightly offbeat, if not downright obscure ingredients. Ramazzotti as an Italian Amaro Bitters, which has a fairly robust and complex flavor. It can present a delightful play of flavors when balanced against the right ingredients. I ran across this drink at the Zig Zag Café in Seattle, where it is regularly one of their go-to drinks when a customer wants something just a bit different.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
43;-Chas;-One of the regulars at the Zig Zag Cafe loved his bourbon cocktails, to the point of never having anything else. There are of course, only so many bourbon cocktail recipes out there, so one time he asked Murray to come up with something different, and this was the result. The customers name was Charles, or "Chaz" to his friends.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=175&width=160
44;-Chrysanthemum Cocktail;-This is one of those rare cocktails which doesn't feature one of the six base spirits (brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, whiskey). Benedictine carries the day here, and since it is 80 proof like a base spirit I suppose it's just a slight deviation.;-Garnish: Orange twist.;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
45;-Clover Club;-;-;-Shake very well with ice.Strain into a wine glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
46;-Coffee Cocktail;-This is a fairly old cocktail, which I believe first appears in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas's Bartender's Guide. In it, he says: "The name of this drink is a misnomer, as coffee and bitters are not to be found among its ingredients, but it looks like coffeee when it has been properly concocted, and hence probably its name." It is important to note his point about "bitters" in the above. What he is pointing out, is that this drink is being classified as a "cocktail", and yet it doesn't include the defining ingredient for a cocktail, bitters.;-Garnish: Grated nutmeg;-Shake hard with ice.Strain into a wine glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
47;-Coffee Nudge;-This was a drink that I often had when I first started going to bars. I suppose it was part of the Seattle weather that caused me to lean towards often asking for a "hot drink", but the Coffee Nudge was one that was often recommended. I was to learn on trips outside o the Pacific Northwest, that you may need to ask for this drink using its alternate name of "Keoke Coffee" in order to get bartenders to know what you want.;-Garnish: Dollop of whip cream;-In a pre-warmed coffee mug, add the brandy, coffee liqueur, and crème de cacao.Pour in the coffee (decaf can be used if desired).;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

First opened in 1827, Delmonico's has suffered through fire, prohibition and a series of proprietors and still serves its famous steaks today. The eponymous cocktail is just as strong and long lived as the restaurant.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=206&width=160
59;-Derby;-Benedictine is one of those products which often is gathering dust at most bars across the country. Typically they will even have just a bottle of "B&B" instead of Benedictine, which only shows that they don't really know how to use this product. So I am always on the lookout for great cocktails which can illustrate the value that Benedictine can bring to a drink. There are a few different cocktails going by the name of "Derby", but the version I show here is one which I think is an excellent drink to introduce people to the potential that Benedictine provides.;-Garnish: Lemon peel;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=248&width=160
60;-Diablo;-It’s hard to say exactly why this drink is called “Diablo” (Devil in Spanish), perhaps it is its red color, or perhaps it’s due to the little bit of spice brought in from the ginger ale. Either way, this is a wonderfully refreshing drink, and a good way to introduce somebody to tequila.;-Garnish: Lime wheel;-Shake tequila, cassis, and lime juice with ice.Strain into a collins glass.Top with ginger ale.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
61;-Diabolo;-From what I can figure out, a Diabolo is an odd-looking juggling device that almost looks like a yo-yo. Not quite sure what that has to do with this cocktail, but who am I to argue. I think the first appearance of this cocktail is in the 1930's "The Savoy Cocktail Book" by Harry Craddock, there he lists a recipe for six people, which I have scalled down here for a single drink.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

63;-Egg Nog;-When most people think of Egg Nog, they simply think of the cardboard cartons tht they can get at the grocery store. I suppose you can develop a taste for that if you want, but I would prefer that you try at least once to make your own from scratch. It isn't terribly difficult, and I think it tastes a LOT better.And while it might sound counter intuitive, aged Egg Nog is even better. Just mix it up and put it in the fridge for a few weeks, or even longer.Another issue that might concern many when thinking about a drink made with raw eggs, has to do with the potential issues of salmonella. I am not a scientist, nor do I play one on TV, but these two videos from Ira Flatow's "Science Friday" website might give you some useful guidance and insight:Another Reason to Spike that Eggnog(http://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/another-reason-to-spike-that-eggnog-2/)It is a question on the minds of many people this season: will adding alcohol to the homemade eggnog safeguard against salmonella? To find out, Science Friday teamed up with eggnog expert and microbiologist Vince Fischetti, who agreed to run some tests in his lab at The Rockefeller University.And a followup/related video:Yet Another Reason to Spike That Eggnog(http://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/yet-another-reason-to-spike-that-eggnog/)A perennial holiday dilemma: will alcohol kill the bacteria in homemade eggnog? Microbiologists Vince Fischetti and Raymond Schuch, from The Rockefeller University, ran an experiment in the lab to see whether salmonella can survive in a vat of spiked eggnog.It has also become fashionable lately to "age" your eggnog. Since the above research appears to indicate that the salmonella fighting properties of alcohol increase with time, this just increases the rationale for this approach. While I haven't really looked into this yet myself (hard to resist drinking my eggnog immediately!), others have.Happy New Year!

65;-Fallen Leaves;-This is a lovely drink that I think reminds me of walking through an apple orchard on a crisp fall day after an early morning rain. I first encountered this drink when a bartender asked me if I happened to know its recipe (a customer having asked her to make one just a few days prior). After looking through countless books from my library to no avail, I finally found it in "American Bar" by Charles Schumann.;-Garnish: Large lemon peel, twisted over drink.;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
66;-Fancy-Free;-While Whiskey has always had its dedicated followers, for a long time it has been shunned by those who might feel the “brown spirits” are something which should be avoided. Lately however, there has been some renewed interest into this classic American spirit, and it’s flavorful characteristics. While a Manhattan might be a little too forward for the beginner, the Fancy-Free might provide a slightly more comfortable introduction.;-;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
67;-Floridita;-The "Floridita" Cocktail gets its name from the Floridita bar in Cuba. If you glance through various cocktail books, you will most likely find a variety of different drinks that go by this name, I'm not sure which one should be considered the original version, but this particular one I find to be quite delightful. You'll also learn about how to make homemade Grenadine in the process. (And as to the name of this drink using the masculine "El" instead of the feminine "La"... I've been told that while the establishment takes the feminine name of "Floridita", in Spanish the bar itself is masculine, and thus "El" should be used. At least that's what I've been told.);-Garnish: Lime twist;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=210&width=160
68;-French 75;-Apparently making it's first printed appearance in Harry Craddock's "The Savoy Cocktail Book" (1930), this drink is named after a 75-millimeter field gun that French forces and the American national Guard used during the First World War. While with "French" in the name, you might think this drink should really use brandy or cognac as the base spirit, but this drink is properly made with gin.;-;-Shake gin, lemon juice, and sugar with ice.

71;-Gibson;-Technically, the Gibson is little more than a dry Martini garnished with pickled cocktail onions instead of a lemon twist (or olives). There can be deep debates as to if it indeed is a recipe needing a name of its own, or if it is in fact, just a Martini. Myself, I lean toward the idea that it is a recipe in its own right, if for no other reason then if a customer asked for a Martini, and you served it with cocktail onion as a garnish, they would feel that they indeed recieved the wrong drink. Likewise, if the customer asked for a Gibson, and you garnished the drink with anything except the cocktail onions, they would rightly question your abilities.;-Garnish: Cocktail onion;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
72;-Gimlet;-There are very few times when I recommend the use of a "commercial mix" when making cocktails. The Gimlet is perhaps my only exception.

94;-Last Word;-There are often drinks which sit lonely and forgotten in some old cocktail book, just waiting to be rediscovered and brought to light. Such was the case with the Last Word. It was Murray Stenson, from the Zig Zag Cafe in Seattle who was browsing through "Bottom's Up" one night and ran across this recipe and decided to dust it off. Since then it was caught the attention of bartenders across the nation and has become "the" new drink that all craft bartenders cherrish. In "Bottom's Up", Ted Saucier has this to say about the drink:Courtesy, Detroit Athletic Club, Detroit "This cocktail was introduced around here about thirty years ago by Frank Fogarty, who was very well known in vaudeville. He was called the 'Dublin Minstrel,' and was a very fine monologue artist.";-;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=214&width=160

96;-Lemon Drop;-The Lemon Drop was intended to represent the flavor of the Lemon Drop candies, which are essentially just citric acid and sugar. So while you may often see triple sec listed as an ingredient for the Lemon Drop, and while it may in fact result in a "better" drink, it isn't an appropriate ingredient for this cocktail since the lemon drop candies don't include any orange flavoring.;-Garnish: Lemon wheel;-Shake with ice.Strain into a sugar rimmed cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

98;-Mahogany;-Jägermeister is one of those products that often gets very little respect amongst serious cocktail drinkers, of which I am one. A good bartender friend of mine once told me I needed to perhaps rethink my stance here. She challenged me to work up a cocktail which it would properly work in, where you could taste the Jägermeister, but without it being overtly a Jägermeister drink. Frankly I think I came up with something quite good with this one.;-;-Stir all except the cinnamon with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass that has been coated with the cinnamon tincture (or cinnamon schnapps).;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
99;-Mai Tai;-Trader Vic's original Mai Tai recipe from 1944 was made with 2 ounces of 17 year old Wray & Nephew rum, the juice from one lime, 1/2 ounce of Holland DeKuyper Orange Curacao, 1/2 ounce of French Garnier Orgeat, and 1/4 ounce Rock Candy Syrup. Today, the Wray & Nephew rum is no longer available, and it was a wonderfully rich flavored rum indeed. My version of the recipe is trying to simplify this drink as much as possible in order to make it easily approached by home bartenders. For this reason I am simply listing an ounce of "full bodied rum" and an ounce of "medium bodied rum", which rums you use is up to you. Because this isn't nearly as heady as the 17 year old Wray & Nephew, I am leaving out the simple syrup, because that would have otherwise made this drink too sweet. Feel free to experiement with different rums on your own, and if you feel it necessary, by all means add a little simple syrup to adjust the balance.;-Garnish: Float of dark rum (optional), and garnish with a lime shell and sprig of mint.;-Shake with ice.Strain into an ice filled Old Fashioned glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=67&width=160
100;-Manhattan;-One of the things that fascinates me most about the Manhattan, is that it is one of the few pre-prohibition cocktails which survives to this day with its recipe, for the most part intact. As would any drink of that day called a cocktail, it still includes bitters, an aspect that its younger sibling, the Martini, can no longer say. Also unlike the Martini, the ratio of spirit to vermouth is usually fairly similar to what would have originally been used. I would even hazard to say that a modern day Manhattan would be completely recognizable to a bartender from the 1880’s.;-Garnish: Maraschino Cherry;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=181&width=160

102;-Martinez;-Many may refer to the Martinez as being simply an early version of the Martini, to the point of refering to the origins of the Martini as being those of the Martinez. I instead feel that both the Martinez and the Manhattan were precursors to the Martini, each being a unique cocktail unto itself.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=180&width=160
103;-Martini;-While I much prefer more vermouth in my Martini than is used here, I think this version provides the "dryness" that most drinkers expect from a gin Martini and yet still gives them a little bit of culinary interest from the vermouth. So while I typically wouldn't recommend serving a 3-to-1 Martini to a random customer who just asks for a (gin) Martini, I think this version would work well for that and begins to provide the customer a little bit of insight as to what they might be typically missing in a Martini;-Garnish: Lemon twist, or a green olive;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
104;-Martini (classic);-While the "original" dry Martini was equal parts gin and dry vermouth, as we lead up to American Prohibition we see the ratios begin to change a bit. While the "equal parts" version is still popular, we are seeing several references to 3 to 2, and even 3 to 1 ratios being used. The version I list here is a 3 to 1 ratio, which is the furthest that I like to take a Martini, because it sill allows the vermouth to participate in the flavors.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
105;-Martini (circa. 1888);-The first time we see a cocktail specifically going by the name "Martini" is in the 1888 edition of Harry Johnson's "New and Improved Bartenders' Manual". While the recipe has a few more ingredients then we are used to, and may almost (but not quite) look more like a Martinez than it does a Martini, it does provide a good starting point to see how the Martini has evolved over time. In his recipe he simply callse for "vermouth" without indicating if it shoudl be dry or sweet. In those days, bartenders would realize that he naturally intended for sweet. While these days bartenders would assume otherwise.It is interesting to note that the illustration that accompanied the recipe in Harry's book labeled the drink as the "Martine" instead of "Martini".;-Garnish: Piece of lemon, squeezed over the top.;-Stir with ice.Strain into a fancy cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=228&width=160
106;-Martini (circa. 1900);-Many people don't realize that the Martini was originally made with sweet vermouth. The recipe shown here, would have been what you probably would have gotten had you simply ordered a "Martini" in most American bars around the 1900's. You may want to experiment a little bit with the ratios since which gin you use, as well as which sweet vermouth, will present a different flavor profile. This drink should be full of flavor, but it shouldn't taste overly sweet.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=217&width=160
107;-Martini - dry (circa. 1900);-The oldest recipe I know of for a "dry" Martini was brought to my attention by Fernando Catellon. He found it in "American Bar—Boissons Anglaise & Américaines", a French cocktail book published in 1904.DRY MARTINI COCKTAILVerre No. 5Prendre le verre à mélange no. 1, mettre quelquesmorceaux de glace:3 traits d’angostura ou orange bitter.Finir avec gin et vermouth sec, quantités égales, remuer, passerdans le verre no. 5, server avec un zeste de citron, une cerise ouune olive, au gout du consommateur.Which tranlates into English as:DRY MARTINI COCKTAILGlass No 5Using mixing glass No 1, and a few pieces of ice:3 dashes of angostura or orange bitter.Finish with gin and dry vermouth, equal quantities, stir well, pourinto glass No 5, serve with a piece of lemon peel, a cherry or anolive, based on the taste of the consumer.While using "equal quantities" of gin and dry vermouth might sound rather severe, as long as you use a good fresh vermouth, it is really a delightful libation.;-Garnish: Lemon twist.;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
108;-Metropole;-The Metropole Cocktail was the house cocktail at the Metropole Hotel, opened in New York just before the beginning of the 20th century. Some say it is a stronger and spicier version of the Manhattan. The original recipe (from Kapplers "Modern American Drinks") used as much dry vermouth as brandy, but the modified version shown here was recommended by Paul E. Lowe, in "Drinks As They Are Mixed" (1904) recommended cutting the dry vermouth by half and adding a barspoon of gum [syrup]". He also recommended using Angostura only, but I still prefer the results o the mixture of orange and peychaud's.;-Garnish: Cherry;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=196&width=160

111;-Mint Julep;-The Mint Julep is one of those grand old drinks that everyone has heard of, but it seems few have ever ordered them. To experience it properly, you really do need to have it in a classic mint julep cup, shiney silver, coated with a thin film of ice, and piled high with finely crushed ice. On a hot summer day, when all of your chores are done, it's hard to imagine anything better. The special silver julep cups can be a little trickey to find, but you can find them either at Kegworks.com or at SilverSuperStore.com where they have a very nice selection and a great price.;-Garnish: Mint sprigs dusted with powdered sugar.;-Muddle in a cocktail shaker until the sugar is dissolved and the mint is blended in.Add ice, and then shake well.Strain into a glass filled with shaved ice.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=156&width=160
112;-Mojito;-The Mojito seems to be "the" drink these days, but this drink dates from before the 1930's, where it was a popular drink in cuba to refresh and relax with. In the 1950's the drink burst onto the international scene when it was "discovered" by Enest Hemmingway at "La Bodeguita del Medio". Properly made, a mojito should always be made with fresh mint and fresh lime juice, but due to its ubiquitous popularity, you will often find bars using various unfortunate shortcuts to make them quicker, but sacrifice the quality in doing so.;-Garnish: Mint sprigs sprinkled with powdered sugar.;-Add the syrup and mint to a mixing glass. Use a muddler to lightly press the mint and form a mint flavored syrup. Add ice, lime juice, rum, and one half of a lime shell (quartered). Shake well, and then strain into an ice filled pint glass.Top with soda.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
113;-Monkey Gland;-In the 1920s Dr. Serge Voronoff, a Russian surgeon living in France, gained more than a small amount of fame and fortune for his practice of implanting into men the testicles of monkeys for apparent therapueutic purposes. This drink was named in "honor" of this practice.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=250&width=160
114;-Monte Carlo;-It seems like these days everybody is trying to come up with “variations” on some particular cocktail, Pomegranate Martinis, Raspberri Manhattans, Strawberry Mojitos… you get the point. If a drink is a Manhattan, call it a Manhattan, if it isn’t don’t. Case in point, the “Monte Carlo”. This drink is essentially a Manhattan in which you have simply switched out the sweet vermouth, for something a little sweeter, and a little more complex, Benedictine. If you like Manhattans, you’ll probably like this drink as well.;-;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

120;-Old Cuban;-This wonderful drink was created by my good friend (and now wife) Audrey Saunders, proprietor of the Pegu Club in New York City. You will notice that it is closely related to the Mojito, but with far more elegance and sophistication. Audrey garnishes her original version with a sugar-coated vanilla bean as shown her in this recipe. If you don't happen to have any handy, feel free to make it without, but you do owe it to yourself to try it one day with that little added extra touch.;-Garnish: Sugar-coated vanilla bean;-Muddle lime juice, syrup, mint in a mixing glass. Add rum, bitters, ice, and shake well. Strain into cocktail glass, and top with champagne.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=234&width=160
121;-Old Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail;-The Old Fashioned represents what is perhaps the oldest form of cocktail known. Unfortunately it has fallen out of favor these days, and I rarely see people ordering it. I suppose this could be partially due to the fact that most bartenders don't know how to properly make it anymore. The atrocities I often see inflicted on this drink include leaving out the bitters, and topping it off with water or soda. Please, stop the madness and let's start making this drink properly again! You will often see recipes suggesting you muddle a half orange wheel with this drink. And while I like the effect the orange essence has overall, I dislike the added pulp that results. Since the oils in the orange peel itself are so wonderful, I prefer to simply cut an orange zest over the glass before pouring in the whiskey. You also shouldn't even think about muddling a cherry in this drink, it doesn't really add anything, except for a mangled carcass on the bottom of the glass. Save it for a garnish instead. It is often cited that this drink was created at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky. David Wondrich however has uncovered evidence which shows this not be the case. He has a reference to the term "Old Fashioned" as applied to a cocktail being used at least a year before the Pendennis Club opened. The term itself, is simply referring to making a cocktail the "Old Fashioned" way, since it was around 1870 that a "new" style of cocktail was emerging, which gave birth to drinks such as the Manhattan and Martini, which don't reflect the classic "spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters" which originally defined the cocktail. While a traditional "whiskey cocktail" would have originally been commonly made with rye whiskey, these days it is more common to find it made with bourbon instead.;-Garnish: Lemon twist and optionally a cherry.;-If you are using a sugar cube instead of the simple syrup, muddle it in the bottom of an Old Fashioned glass with the bitters and a teaspoon of water. Then add the ice, followed by the whiskey, and stir to chill.You can also use Bourbon whiskey for this, in which case I recommend using an orange twist instead of a lemon twist.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=34&width=160
122;-Old Pal;-The Old Pal Cocktail first appears in "Barflies and Cocktails" (1927) by Harry MacElhone of the famed Harry's New York Bar in Paris. There it was listed as using sweet vermouth, but in the 1930 edition of "ABC of Mixing Cocktails" he changed the recipe to use dry vermouth instead. While you will often find bartenders these days using American Rye whiskey for this drink, I find that Canadian whisky provides a little better balance with the dry vermouth.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

130;-Pink Gin;-Nothing could be simpler, gin and bitters. It may not be a drink I'd recommend to somebody just getting interested in cocktails, but once you've grown accustomed to the normal lineup, it's a great drink to try. The amount of bitters can easily be adjusted either up or down depending on your tastes.;-;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=249&width=160

132;-Pisco Sour;-The Pisco Sour is perhaps the most famous drink that uses this special South American form of brandy. The key ratios as standardized in Peru is 3 parts Pisco, 1 part lime juice, 1 part simple syrup. The egg white adds a lushious mouth-feel to it, and the bitters dashed on top add both a nice aromatic nose to it, plus perhaps more importantly will elimiate the "wet dog" smell that an egg white foam will cause.;-Garnish: Dash of bitters;-Shake everything except the bitters hard with ice.Strain into a champagne flute.Use the bitters as an aromatic garnish to the top of this drink.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

138;-Ramos Gin Fizz;-This is a classic New Orleans cocktail invented in the 1880s by Henry C. Ramos at his bar in Meyer’s Restaurant. The original recipe required 12 minutes of shaking to achieve the proper creamy consistency. You could try that to see if you like the results better.;-;-Shake all ingredients, except the soda water, very hard with ice (at least a minute). This should result in a fairly foamy consistancy.

139;-Red Snapper;-If you dig into the often confusing history of the Bloody Mary, you will encounter references to it first being served in 1934 at the St. Regis hotel in New York by Fernand Petiot who brought the recipe with him from Paris (where some accounts claim he invented it). Since the name “Bloody Mary” was deemed to be a little to vulgar for the establishment, it was re-christened the “Red Snapper”, it is also said that since vodka wasn’t yet easily available here in the US, gin was used instead. Eventually the original name was returned to the drink, but the Red Snapper continued to be made with gin instead of vodka.;-Garnish: Celery stalk and a lemon wedge;-Shake with ice, then strain into an ice filled highball glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=251&width=160
140;-Renaissance;-As we all know, bitters are a crucial ingredient for many cocktails. A few old recipes referred to peach bitters, but no product survived to modern days. Fee Brothers then produced their version, and I took it on myself to see if I could come up with a few cocktails that might be able to make good use of it. The Renaissance is one of them that I came up with. I think that it is a delightfully approachable drink that is just slightly on the sweet side. I was pleased to see it listed one day on the cocktail menu at "Licorous" a great little cocktail bar here in Seattle.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=212&width=160

142;-Rob Roy;-The Rob Roy gets it's name from an opera by the same name which opened in New York in 1894. In those days it was common to bring about new cocktails and name them after popular shows. For the Rob Roy, they simply took an existing popular cocktail, the Manhattan, and substituted the rye for scotch. Most likely, it would have typically been made with Dewar's blended scotch, which had just recently begun being imported into the states.David Wondrich has dug into the details of the Rob Roy and his research would indicate that it originated around 1895, in Hoboken New Jersey at "Duke's House". A salesman for Usher's Scotch Whiskey, when faced with an invitation to drink Manhattans, asked the bartender (Henry A. Orphal) to mix up something with Usher's whiskey instead. He swapped out the American whiskey for Scotch, and christened it the Rob Roy.

143;-Rosita;-The Rosita is a drink I first encountered in August 1999 issue of GQ Magazine. It was in an article written by Terry Sullivan, where he was providing a cautionary tale about drinking too much tequila. The Rosita didn't figure in his tale, but for whatever reason he chose to end the article with this delightful little drink. After trying it, I decided it was probably my favorite tequila cocktail, and one that rarely appeared to be listed in cocktail books of the day.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into an ice filled Old Fashioned glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

145;-Saratoga;-Originally, cocktails had such fanciful names as “gin cocktail”, “whiskey cocktail”, and “brandy cocktail”. Now that is some creativity the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time. Such names were common in the original bartender’s guide published in 1862 by Jerry Thomas. By the time he published his second book in 1887; cocktail names had taken a decidedly different turn. Besides the Manhattan, Morning Glory, and Martinez cocktail, we also see one of the first appearances of the Saratoga cocktail. This variation on a Manhattan includes brandy along with the whiskey.;-Garnish: Lemon slice;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

148;-Scofflaw;-The word "Scofflaw" has come to mean "A person who flouts the law, especially an unsustainable one.", but such was not always the case.It was in 1923, when Delcevare King, a member of the Anti-Saloon League, posed a contest to create a new word in order to combat the continued drinking which was going on during American Prohibition. The new word was to be one "which best expresses the idea of a lawless drinker, menace, scoffer, bad citizen, or whatnot, with the biting power of 'scab' or 'slacker.'" The $200 prize elicited a huge response. On January 16th, 1924, the Boston Herald announced the winning word as "scofflaw", with the winnings shared by the two Boston area residents, Henry Irving Dale and Kate L. Butler, who both submitted it.This was not the end of the story however, in just a little over a week, a salvo was launched from Harry's New York Bar in Paris, where they created a new drink and christened it the "Scofflaw".;-Garnish: Lemon wedge;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

150;-Sidecar;-The Sidecar is a classic cocktail which most bartenders know, but seems to be rarely ordered. Part of this is because it is poorly made, and more often than not made with sour mix instead of fresh ingredients. Properly made this drink should be made with cognac (or brandy), Cointreau, and fresh lemon juice. There are however a variety of ways these ingredients can be combined, the secret is how to do so in a way that presents a perfect balance.;-;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=221&width=160
151;-Singapore Sling;-Cocktails often have a habit of taking on a life of their own, and almost becoming more legend than actual libation. The Singapore Sling by name is a drink that is found on cocktail menus across the country, but the recipes being used take on almost every form imaginable as long as they loosely approximate the slightly foamy fruit-punch image the drink conjures up. It is said that even at Raffels Hotel in Singapore, where the drink was created, the "original" recipe is no longer being served. My recipe below is the same as was listed on a recipe card that Raffles hotel makes (or at least made) available which described the general history of the drink as well as it's recipe. I have reproduced that card in my writeup about the drink below.;-Garnish: Cherry and slice of pineapple;-Shake with ice.Strain into an ice filled Collins glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=185&width=160

155;-Straits Sling;-Of course almost everybody has heard of the famous Singapore Sling, invented at Raffles Hotel in Singapore. What they might not know, is that sometime during the 1930’s they stopped serving the drink, and when they decided to start making it again, they discovered they no longer had the original recipe. As the rumor goes, an old customer had a recipe written on the back of an old napkin, and they used that to bring back the drink. There are some who say that this isn’t the same recipe, instead they feel that the “original” Singapore Sling recipe is found here, in the recipe for the “Straits Sling”. We may never know.;-;-Shake everything, except for the soda water, with ice.Strain into an ice filled Collins glass.Top with soda water.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

158;-Tillicum;-I sometimes like to play around a little with thinking about different garnishing possibilities. One day I was in the grocery store and saw a packet of raw smoked salmon on sale, this packet was the bits and ends left over after making those fancy packets of "Lox", and while perfectly good, wasn't quite pretty enough to be used for a finely turned out buffet. I felt their size however would work really well in a cocktail. My first try was just with an ordinary Martini, and found that it worked really well, so I created this drink to better match the salmon with a salmon-ish colored drink. The name for the drink comes from the local Tillicum Indians, they would smoke their salmon around a fire by splaying them out on wooden sticks, so I skewered the salmon such that it mimics this effect.;-Garnish: Slice of smoked salmon skewered flat on a pick;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
159;-Tip Top;-I am not sure where this drink comes from although I first found the recipe in "Old Waldorf Bar Days", by Albert Crockett Stevens from 1931. What I find the most fascinating about this drink, is that it uses dry vermouth as it's base. With so much vermouth, please don't try to use that tired old bottle that might be sitting in your liquor cabinet. Pick up a nice fresh bottle of a good quality vermouth, and really see what it can do.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
160;-Tom and Jerry (batter mix);-Dating from the early 1800’s, the Tom & Jerry can be described as a hot variation of an eggnog, and likewise is traditionally served at Christmas time.The first known reference to the Tom & Jerry as a drink comes from the Salem Gazette of March 20, 1827 in the form of recounting an incident in Police Court, where a “lad of about thirteen years of age” was tried for theft. He was acquitted because it was deemed he was “…deranged, probably in consequence of the “hell-broth” that he had been drinking”. The drink was named “Tom and Jerry”, and described as “eggs, sugar, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and rum”.There are a few slight variations of the Tom & Jerry, some use rum only, others brandy only, but I think the combination of rum in the batter and brandy in the drink makes for a good balance. You’ll also often see the drink made with hot water, but I find that hot milk makes for a richer drink that just seems more appropriate for a cold winter day.As the story goes, Tom & Jerry’s should never be served until after the first snow, so sit back and watch the weather, and the moment that first flake begins to float out of the heavens, see if  you can have your drink warming your hands before it hits the ground.;-Garnish: Grated nutmeg;-Beat egg whites to a stiff froth, and the yolks until they are as thin as water. Mix yolks and whites together and add the rum, spices, and cream of tartar. Thicken with sugar until the mixture attains the consistence of a light batter. In a coffee mug, combine one table-spoonful of the above mixture, and 2 ounces of brandy, and then fill the glass with piping hot milk.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=252&width=160

162;-Trident;-Probably one of my most successful cocktails has been the Trident. I originally created this drink when I was working with Fee Brothers Peach Bitters. There were very few recipes which specifically called for it, and I felt that there was plenty of room therefore for a few more. I had recently found that switching in aquavit for the gin in a Negroni produced great results, and thought I'd take this a little further. Since I have a facination for slightly obscure ingredients, I decided to try a Negroni variation in which each ingredient was something you might not typically find in ordinary bars. After a few experiments, the Trident was the result. The name comes from notion that each of the three main ingredients come from three different sea-faring countries. Here in Seattle, the Zig Zag Cafe has had this on their cocktailo menu for quite a while, apparently it is the reason they go through more Cynar than all the other bars in Washington State combined. It has also made it onto the menus of many of the better bars around the US as well as the world.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=173&width=160

164;-Vesper;-It is said, that Ian Flemming designed this drink himself, with the help of bartenders at Dukes hotel in London. He apparently was fairly proud of it, but unfortunately it never shows up again. In the movies Bond tends toward straight vodka more often than not. Fortunately, Casino Royale was finally made into a full-fledge Bond movie, and in it this drink is once again introduced to the public. The new movie is intended to take place in the modern day, but James still orders his drink using “Kina Lillet”, this either shows that the scriptwriters didn’t really do any research on the product at all, or were intent on preserving the dialog from the book while sacrificing accuracy.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
165;-Vieux Carre;-The Vieux Carre was created by Walter Bergeron (head bartender at the Hotel Monteleone) in 1938. Today, the hotel bar is well known for its Carousel Bar (built in 1949), which is a bar that actually is a carousel that spins slowly around. The name Vieux Carre is French for "the Old Square", which is the French name for the "French Quarter".;-Garnish: Lemon twist.;-Build over ice, in an Old Fashioned glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=218&width=160
166;-Ward 8;-The Ward 8 appears to date back to 1898, and is one of the few drinks that can trace it's roots back to Boston. It was supposedly concocted for the victory dinner of politician Martin "The Mahatma" Lomasney, to celebrate his recent election. Most stories put this at the "Winter Palace Hotel" (known also as "Frank Locke’s" or "Locke-Ober"), but others reference "Lomasney’s Puritan Club", and there are a few stories which remove it from Boston all together.;-;-Shake with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

169;-Widow's Kiss;-The Widow's Kiss is a fairly old cocktail, dating back to around 1895. This was during a time when a "new" age of cocktails were coming into existence as bartenders were letting it expand beyond its previously held definition of "spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters". They were experimenting with the use of vermouth (and hence the Martini and Manhattan), as well as various herbal liqueurs which would have previously been simply sipped neat. The Window's Kiss doubles up on its elixir content by using both Chartreuse and Benedictine. If you can only find green Chartreuse and not yellow, you can substitute it if you cut back on it by about a third.;-;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

176;-Zummy;-Looking over the measures here, you might think that this is a fairly small drink, and you'd be right. This isn't a pre-dinner drink, but an after-dinner one. The high amount of Benedictine in it make it relatively sweet, so a "4 ounce drink" would probably be a little too much. I'm not sure where I first found this drink, but I suspect I was trying to increase the number of Benedictine drinks in my collection.;-;-Stir with ice.Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

188;-Petruchio;-Aperol was first introduced in 1919 at the first "Padova Fiere", a trade exhibition held in Padova Italy.

So I named this drink after the lead character "Petruchio".;-Garnish: Orange Twist;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
189;-Ding Ho;-A few weeks back I was in "Chopsticks", a little Chinese restaurant near me where they specialize in Trader Vic Mai Tai's made from scratch, and I saw he had an unopened bottle of St-Germain on the back shelf. The owner had no idea what to do with it, just loved the bottle and so bought it. I decided to try to make them up a "house specialty" cocktail to use it in, and so tried a variation of the Mai Tai... I named it "Ding Ho", since that means in Chinese about the same thing as Mai Tai means in Polynesian.;-Garnish: cherry and lime wedge.;-Shake with ice.

190;-Elderthorn;-Elderflower syrup was one of those ingredients which I often saw used in cocktails popular in the U.K., but for some reason nobody has ever been producing/distributing it here in the US. Recently St-Germain Elderflower liqueur came out and it was so amazing I just had to start using it in some cocktails. This was one of my first creations with it. The name comes from Elderflower of course, as well as the thorny side of Cynar, since it is made with artichokes.;-;-Stir with ice.

191;-Woodsman Sour;-I'm always on the lookout for slightly unusual, if not downright bizarre ingredients. So of course when I saw a bottle of Clear Creek's "Eau de Vie of Douglas Fir" I just had to pick up a bottle, even if it was $50 for a small 350ml bottle. This product sort of follows along the line of the obscure Alsatian liqueur known as "Eau de Vie de Bourgeons de Sapin" (translates to "brandy of fir tree buds"). I decided to pair this up with St-Germain to form a nice blending of two "woodland" oriented products.;-;-Shake with ice.

There are several recipes for this floating about.

219;-Grasshopper;-This cocktail was apparently created by Philibert Guichet Jr., the owner of Tujaque's bar in New Orleans. As the story goes, it was submitted as an entry to a New York cocktail contest which was held, amazingly enough, in 1928 just before Prohibition was repealed. It is reported to have won second place. (Source: Roy F. Guste, Jr. "The Restaurants of New Orleans") Some other sources refer to the contest happening in 1919 however, just prior to Prohibition. However since one of the reported judges was Walter Winchell, who's career didn't really start until 1920, it is more likely that the contest happened during Prohibition.;-;-Shake well with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=247&width=160

222;-Twenty-First Century Cocktail;-The 20th Century cocktail has been around for… well… about a century. Isn’t it time we had something a little more up-to-date? Jim Meehan, of PDT in New York City, felt the same way, and so he came up with this delightful variation that is well worth trying. I appreciate it because it uses tequila, and I personally think the world needs a few more good tequila cocktail recipes.;-;-Coat the glass with the absinthe, then shake everything else with ice and strain into the prepared cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
223;-Vacation;-This drink was created by Zane Harris, bartender at Vessel which is an excellent craft bar in downtown Seattle. I asked him for some ideas on a “summertime” cocktail, and he said this is one that he had recently worked up. He said it was a good summertime drink not only because it uses cachaça, but also because of the use of egg whites. Zane had noticed that during the summer, people tend to gravitate towards his egg white drinks more than they do the rest of the year.;-;-Shake with ice, strain into a champagne flute.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
224;-Fourth Regiment Cocktail;-This is a drink which I would not have previously listed, since it uses "celery bitters". There are a few old cocktails which reference this product, but to the best of my knowledge it hasn't been made for over a hundred years. Fortunately, the folks over at "The Bitter Truth" have been able to bring this product back to the market, and so some of these old cocktails can once again be brought back into practice.;-Garnish: Lemon twist;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=195&width=160
225;-Norwegian Wood;-A delightful cocktail created by Jeffrey Morgenthaler of Clyde Commons in Portland. He was challenged by a liquor rep to make something with aquavit, a far under-represented spirit, and this is what he came up with. It has a nice bright crispness along with a well layered complexity. Perhaps not one for the novice, but when you're ready for a little adventure, I'd definately pull this one out.You can read about this drink in Jeffrey's own words on his blog.;-Garnish: lemon twist;-Stir ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail coupe.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
226;-Smoke and Mirrors;-This cocktail was created by Neil Kopplin, bartender at Clyde Commons in Portland Oregon. I regularly like to substitute aquavit for the gin in my Negronis, but Neil has taken this one step further by essentially substituting Cynar for the sweet vermouth. While Cynar is quite a bit more robust than sweet vermouth is, it still behaves much the same way in this drink when balanced against the Campari. If you like drinks like the Negroni, and the Trident, you'll definately like this drink too.;-Garnish: Flamed orange peel.;-Stir with ice, strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
227;-Seelbach;-Long believed to be a "forgotten classic" house cocktail of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville Kentucky, it is now known to be a fabrication of the then bartender at the Seelbach hotel, Adam Seger. It was around 1995 when the fledgling bartender tried to dig through the hotels past to see if he could find a "specialty of the house", but never did. So instead he created this cocktail, and then a fanciful, and plausible, story around it having been created there in 1912.Full story here:http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/seelbach-cocktail-louisville-fake.html;-Garnish: Lemon Twist;-Build in a champagne flute.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
228;-Little Italy;-Rye whiskey has seen an all-important resurgance in the last few years, and one of the people we can thank for that is Audrey Saunders of the Pegu Club in New York NY. The "Little Italy" is one of the drinks that she specifically created to make use of this forgotten style of Whiskey, and it's been going like gangbusters ever since.;-Garnish: Luxardo maraschino cherry, plus just a little bit of the syrup.;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
229;-Outrigger;-Sour style cocktails are some of the most popular in the world: Margarita, Sidecar, Daiquiri, to name a few. Take a spirit, add juice from any citrus and a sweetening agent like simple syrup or your favorite liqueur and you have a sour style cocktail. This is essentially what Jeff "Beachbum" Berry did when he invented the Outrigger. Based upon the Sidecar, Jeff says this about his creation,"as with cognac in a Sidecar, the older the rum you use in the Outrigger, the better it tastes!";-;-Shake with ice, strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=176&width=160
230;-Hot Buttered Rum;-For some reason, people have gotten into the habit of thinking that in order to make a Hot Buttered Rum, you need to use a batter mix. This means either taking the time to mix it up from scratch yourself, or buying a pre-mix from the store. Either way, you will end up with far too much if all you want is a single drink. There isn't any reason why you can't mix up a Hot Buttered Rum ala minute, so why not?;-Garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg and optionally a stick of cinnamon.;-Put the butter and sugar into a pre-heated mug and add the boiling water. Stir to dissolve, then add the rum and stir again.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=183&width=160
231;-Fancy Whiskey Cocktail;-The Old Fashioned is an old and distinguished cocktail, as well as one of my personal favorites. Many may point to its origins as being at the Pendennis Club in Louisville Kentucky around 1890, but its true roots go much deeper. Today we call it the “Old Fashioned” because it is a cocktail that is made in the true "old fashioned" way. You might even say it is the original cocktail, although in those days it would simply have been known as a “whiskey cocktail”, which with a little fancy embellishments becomes the “Fancy Whiskey Cocktail”.;-Garnish: lemon twist;-Stir with ice, strain into a cocktail glass rimmed with lemon;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=187&width=160
232;-Royalist;-A nice twist on a Manhattan style of cocktail. It uses dry vermouth instead of sweet, but the Benedictine provides the difference, along with some interesting extra character.;-;-Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=197&width=160
233;-Black Hawk;-I ran across this cocktail in the Jones Complete Bar Guide when I was trying to find some drinks that used Sloe Gin. I think it is a great new introduction to this product, now that some good brands are once again coming onto the market.;-Garnish: cherry;-Shake with ice, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=202&width=160
234;-Apricot Cocktail;-I first found this in "The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks" by David Embury. The gin and the apricot together provide an interesting flavor combination.;-Garnish: cherry;-Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=201&width=160
235;-Bourbon Milk Punch;-It's time for breakfast in New Orleans. What to serve? Along side your grits and andouille there is nothing better than a smooth and creamy bourbon milk punch. After five days of revelry at Tales of the Cocktail there could be nothing better to sooth your aching belly.;-Garnish: grated nutmeg;-Shake vigorously with ice, strain into a brandy snifter or wine glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=200&width=160
236;-Lion's Tail;-Long missing from the liquor cabinet, Pimento Dram (aka. Allspice Dram, aka. Pimento Liqueur) is once again making an appearance. So we dust off this little beauty to provide folks with a delicious way to use that product.;-;-Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=199&width=160
237;-Ocean Shore;-Having no relation to the beachside Washington state town of (almost) the same name, the Ocean Shore Cocktail is nonetheless reminiscent of the sea. Its lavender blue hue topped with froth created by the addition of egg white and a good hard shake, is reminiscent of the sea.;-;-Shake hard with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=198&width=160
238;-Suburban;-Named after the Suburban Handicap horse race held in the Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay during the 1800s, the Suburban Cocktail comes to us via the Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book. It was meant to celebrate men such as James R Keene who made their riches in stocks and owned a number of horses.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Stir with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=205&width=160
239;-Spencer;-This is another drink from The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock, and one that isn’t seen hardly at all as far as I can tell. Apricot Brandy can be a bit of a challenging ingredient to understand when used in a recipe like this, since it could either mean a true brandy distilled from Apricot juice, or it could also mean a sweet liqueur flavored with apricot flesh and seeds. We are going to assume that it is the liqueur that was intended for this cocktail.;-Garnish: Cherry and orange peel;-Shake well and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=223&width=160
240;-Hakam;-Found in the Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock, this drink is quite similar to that of the Martinez, although many Martinez recipes will specifically call for Old Tom gin, and/or the use of Marachino liqueur.  It’s hard to say where this drink originates, or exactly what is intended by its name, but “Hakam” means “A Wise Man” in Hebrew.;-;-Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=225&width=160
241;-White Lady;-Without looking too hard, you'll find a few different recipes going by the name "White Lady", two, and perhaps three or even four, of them are all from the same bartender, Harry MacElhone, who created the drink in 1919. His original recipe called for Creme de Menthe, Cointreau, and Lemon Juice. In "ABC of Mixing Drinks" he lists it as Brandy, Creme de Menthe, and Cointreau, and then in 1923, when he took over the New York Bar in Paris, he updated the recipe again to be gin, Cointreau, and lemon juice, which is far more palatable. I've also seen reference to him listing this drink with egg white as well.The recipe I am listing here, is as it was served by Harry Craddock at the Savoy cocktail bar in London.;-;-Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
242;-San Martin;-;-Garnish: lemon peel;-Stir with ice, strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
243;-Attention;-The original recipe for this called for equal parts of all four ingredients. Such a drink would be far too unbalanced, but feel free to give it a try if you want. The recipe shown here is more of a modified dry Martini, with the absinthe and violette being supporting actors instead of co-stars.;-;-Stir with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
244;-Washington;-This drink, from The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock, basically follows the very early renditions of the Martini and the Manhattan, although using Brandy as the spirit. It also uses dry vermouth instead of the sweet that was commonly used in the Manhattan, as well as the early Martini as well. Following the common nomenclature for these “Modern” cocktails of the late 1800’s, I suppose technically this drink should be called a “Dry” Washington Cocktail.;-;-Stir with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
245;-Ford;-The Ford Cocktail makes its first appearance in George J. Kapeler’s “Modern American Drinks”, published in 1895. The ingredients are the same as found in the “Caprice” cocktail, but the change in ratios makes this a very different cocktail indeed.;-Garnish: orange twist;-Stir with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=230&width=160
246;-Biter;-You wouldn’t be wrong to look at this drink as being fairly similar to the now well-known “Last Word”, the difference of course, is that the ratios here are slightly different, the use of lemon juice instead of lime, the added touch of absinthe, and no maraschino liqueur. Together, these changes make this clearly a different drink.;-;-Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=231&width=160
247;-Young Man;-It is believed that this drink was created by Harry Craddock, head bartender of the Savoy in London. Harry was an American bartender who decided to ply his trade overseas when American Prohibition hit. He joined the Savoy in 1920 and in 1930, he came out with “The Savoy Cocktail Book”, which was fairly popular, even in America where Prohibition was still in effect, although many realized it was on its last legs.;-Garnish: Cherry;-Stir with ice and strain into a cocktail glass;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=232&width=160
248;-Intro to Aperol;-This drink, created by Audrey Saunders of the Pegu Club in New York, has become a mainstay of many bars across the country to introduce people to Aperol, the lower proof (and lighter tasting) cousin of Campari.;-Garnish: orange peel;-Shake with ice, strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
249;-Weeski;-Necessity can often be a wonderful inspiration. David Wondrich created this drink several years ago when he wanted to bring a bottle of pre-mixed Manhattans to a gathering of friends on Halloween. But his liquor cabinet was missing a few critical ingredients. So using what was at hand, he crafted together a drink which focused on Jameson and Lillet, and the "Weeski" was born.;-Garnish: orange twist;-Stir with ice, strain into a cocktail glass;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
250;-Bamboo;-There are several accounts of the origins of this name. One claims the name comes from Bob Cole's 1902 hit song "Under the Bamboo Tree", but William Boothby, a noted bartender of the day, says in his 1908 book "The World's Drinks" that the drink was created and named by Louis Eppinger, at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, Japan.;-Garnish: Orange twist;-Stir with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
251;-Harvest Moon;-The December 1934 edition of Esquire Magazine includes a list of the “Top 10” most popular cocktails. The list starts with an Old Fashioned, and ends with a Daiquiri. The rest of the drinks on the list are reasonably well known. One of them, The Harvest Moon, appears to be MIA for most bartenders. It is described as being a “applejack sour with orgeat”.;-;-Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
252;-Guion;-This drink was named for a member of the family which founded the Guion Line, a steamship company which operated from 1866 to 1892 and was one of the primary steamship lines providing transportation from London to New York. This drink was probably created at the Waldorf Astoria bar.;-;-Stir the gin, vermouth, and bitters with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass and then float the Benedictine on top.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
253;-Fairbanks;-Often referred to as the "Fairbank" cocktail (no "s"), the earliest reports I find of this drink (July 22, 1907) clearly refer to it as "Fairbanks".According to the Savoy Cocktail book, this drink was named after Douglas Fairbanks, but in 1920 (10 years earlier) Robert Vermeire in “Cocktails: How To Mix Them” probably provides the truer tale with indication that it was named after Charles Warren Fairbanks, who was Theodore Roosevelt’s vice president.;-Garnish: Cherry;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
254;-Prohibition;-This drink clearly comes from the era of American Prohibition. I found it in the Savoy Cocktail Book, which was published in 1933, so even if this wasn’t its first in-print appearance, it had to be pretty close. This recipe specifically called for Plymouth gin, as well as Kina Lillet. Plymouth is of course still around, but there is some debate as to if the currently available Lillet is the same as was once marketed as “Kina Lillet”. Some evidence appears to indicate that the product was reformulated sometime in the past, and it’s bitterness from the quinine might have been softened at that time.;-;-Stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
255;-Flame of Love;-This drink was created by Pepe Ruiz, bartender at Chasen’s in Beverly Hills. Dean Martin had apparently grown tired of the same Martini over and over again, and asked Pepe for something different. This is the drink Pepe came up with.;-;-Coat a chilled martini glass with the sherry and pour out the excess. Flame several orange peels into the glass (about 8 times). Stir the vodka with ice, then strain into the glass. Squeeze an orange peel over the drink and then rub it around the rim to coat it well.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
256;-Apricot Lady;-;-;-Vigorously dry shake all ingredients to fully emulsify egg white. Remove strainer spring, if used, and add ice to mixing tin. Shake to chill and dilute. Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
257;-Queen’s Park Swizzle;-The traditional version of this Trinidad swizzle is made with the dark, smoky caramel tones of Demerara rum; the 80-proof bottling from Lemon Hart is recommended, and the Demerara rums from El Dorado are also wonderful. In 1946, none other than Trader Vic himself, apostle of rum, dubbed it "the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today.";-Garnish: Mint sprig and a squeezed out lime shell.;-Gently muddle mint leaves in a Collins or chimney glass.Add rum, simple syrup, lime juice and bitters.Fill glass with crushed ice and swizzle or stir to combine ingredients.Top with more crushed ice and serve with straws.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
258;-Eye Opener;-For a variety of reasons, it can be a difficult task forcing one's eyes to open in the morning. Fortunately, early on, our imbibing forefathers and mothers created smooth and delicious concoctions that might help gently lift our eyelids to greet the day.;-;-Shake strenuously with cracked ice, then strain into a chilled Old-Fashioned glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

261;-French Pearl;-This elegant modern classic provides a delightful tribute to the French Beaux-Arts movement from the late 1800's when Absinthe and afterwards Pastis were all the rage. The term "Pearl" refers to the opalescent louching effect that occurs when pastis and cold water mix.;-Garnish: lime wheel and mint sprig.;-Combine the lime juice, cane syrup, and mint sprig in a cocktail shaker.Muddle the ingredients.Next, add the Pernod and gin.Fill the shaker to the top with ice and shake well.Double strain into a chilled cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
262;-Bramble;-One of the early "new modern classic" cocktails to come out of London, from famed bartender Dick Bradsell.;-Garnish: Lemon slice, blackberries;-Fill a rocks glass with crushed ice and add gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Stir to combine and chill. Carefully drizzle crème de mure on top.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
263;-Penicillin;-This drink is quickly becoming a favorite of craft bartenders across the country. It was created by Sam Ross while he was bartending at Milk & Honey in New York sometime in 2005. He sees it as a "gateway" drink which can help to introduce newcomers to the complexities of a peaty scotch without overpowering them.;-Garnish: Candied ginger;-Crush the ginger in a shaker with a muddler and add the remaining ingredients except for the Laphroiag (or other heavily peated single-malt whisky).Fill the shaker with ice and shake to chill.Double-strain into an ice-filled rocks glass.Float the Laphroiag on top and garnish.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
264;-Harvard Fizz;-The original version of this drink was known as the "Harvard Cocktail" from 1895, which had a slightly different recipe. This "Fizz" version of it evolved from that one and is served as a traditional "Fizz" instead of in a cocktail glass.The original Harvard Cocktail recipe was:"One dash gum-syrup, three dashes Angostura bitters, half-jigger Italian vermouth, half-jigger brandy in half a mixing-glass of fine ice. Mix, strain into cocktail-glass, fill up with seltzer.";-Garnish: Orange slice;-Build in a highball glass (10 ounce) with ice and top with soda.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160

267;-Boulevardier;-Essentially a "Bourbon Negroni". It originally appeared in "Barflies and Cocktails" (1927) using equal parts of all three ingredients. Boosting up the bourbon helps to make a more balanced cocktail.;-Garnish: lemon twist;-Stir with ice, and strain into a cocktail glass.;-http://drinkboy.com/ImageHandler.ashx?imageid=245&width=160
